Parnik
=============
Automated greenhouse control system.




Description
-----------

Our project is based on an adaptive method in which a several parameters such as temperature, humidity, amount of light, CO2,
soil moisture, nutrients are measured and controlled inside a greenhouse. 
The system responds to the parametric changes according a specific algoritm that is specifically designed to ensure best
growth condition- "cultivation of vegetation in controlled environment, providing them artificial environment that facilitate
their growth".


The Smart Greenhouse System is consist of several modules:

1. Moisture sensors.

2. Specific actuators.

3. System GateWay.

4. Cloud analyzing, remote monitoring and remote control.

Тhе above the scheme is common presentation with individual blocks.	


**Since the project is  a for private client only certain blocks of the system I am going to publish in the current repository, adding further explanations and diagrams of realization. DRAFT**
